Welcome to my GitHub! I'm passionate about using data, storytelling, and policy to create meaningful impact—particularly in health, humanitarian, and community-driven contexts. With a strong foundation in public health and experience working with non-profits, international organizations, and newcomer-serving agencies, I bring a human-centered approach to data, research, and systems thinking.
